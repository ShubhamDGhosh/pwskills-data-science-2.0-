It is used to summarize and make sense of numerical information, helping people draw conclusions and make informed decisions based on data. Statistics plays a crucial role in various fields, including science, business, economics, social sciences, and more, by providing methods for understanding and describing patterns and relationships within data."

    "   - **Example:** Mean, median, mode, range, standard deviation, and histograms are all descriptive statistics. For instance, calculating the average (mean) score of students in a class provides a summary measure that represents the typical performance in that class.\n",
    "   - **Use:** Descriptive statistics are used to organize and simplify data, identify patterns, and communicate key insights. They are valuable for summarizing data to make it more manageable and interpretable.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Inferential Statistics:**\n",
    "   - **Purpose:** Inferential statistics, on the other hand, are used to make predictions, draw conclusions, or make inferences about a population based on a sample of data. They extend insights from a sample to a larger population.\n",
    "   - **Example:** Hypothesis testing, confidence intervals, and regression analysis are examples of inferential statistics. For instance, if you want to determine if a new drug is effective, you might conduct a study on a sample of patients and use inferential statistics to make statements about its effectiveness for the entire population of patients with that condition.\n",
    "   - **Use:** Inferential statistics are critical for making decisions, conducting research, and drawing broader conclusions. They help researchers and analysts assess the significance of relationships, test hypotheses, and make predictions about populations based on limited data.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, descriptive statistics provide a summary and understanding of data, while inferential statistics enable us to make inferences or decisions about populations based on sample data. Both types of statistics are essential in the field of statistics and data analysis, and they complement each other in providing insights into different aspects of data."
